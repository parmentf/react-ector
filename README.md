# React ECTOR

This is the React app for [ECTOR](https://github.com/parmentf/node-ector) chatterbot.

This client-side application uses an API, which has to be declared in the `REACT_APP_BACKEND` environment variable.
For exemple, on https://ector.herokuapp.com/, I use https://ector-backend.herokuapp.com (without slash at the end).
